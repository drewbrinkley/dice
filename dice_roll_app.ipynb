    "* Strings\n",
    "* Variables\n",
    "* Functions\n",
    "* Using the ```input()``` function to get user's input\n",
    "* If-statements and conditionals\n",

I decided to build this app to practice the concepts I have been learning as well as getting more expereince commenting my code and creating supporting documentation.  I also created my first git repository and pushed the files to Github to begin utilizing version control.\n",

Complying with this principle ensures that changes in functionality of a portion of that code will not break the rest of the code.
