    "## Introduction\n",
    "I am currently working my way through Zed A. Shaw's book, **_Learn Python 3 the Hard Way_**, to learn how to code in Python.  So far, the material covered includes topics such as:\n",
    "* Strings\n",
    "* Variables\n",
    "* Functions\n",
    "* Using the ```input()``` function to get user's input\n",
    "* If-statements and conditionals\n",
    "* Loops, to include _for_ and _while_\n",

    "I encountered an article describing how to use Python to code an application with a text-based user interface that will simulate rolling a number of dice, as defined by the user.  I decided to build this app to practice the concepts I have been learning as well as getting more expereince commenting my code and creating supporting documentation.  I also created my first git repository and pushed the files to Github to begin utilizing version control.\n",

    "The app created in this project will simulate rolls of 6-sided dice, and the number of dice rolled will be between 1 and 6 as specified by the user.  After each roll, the appliation will generate a visual representation of the results to display on the screen.  The application will facilitate the required user input via a minimalistic text-based user interface (**TUI**).\n",
